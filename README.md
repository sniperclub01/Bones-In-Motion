# Bones in Motion

## VR Motion Capture Solution

Bones in Motion is a Virtual Reality (VR) motion capture solution that leverages the SteamVR Plugin and the OpenXR API within the Unity Engine. This project enables the recording of positions and transformations of the human body in VR, providing a powerful tool for animators and content creators. The captured data can be exported as an animated .fbx file, facilitating seamless integration with various 3D modeling and animation software, such as Maya.

## Features

- **VR Motion Capture:** Utilize SteamVR and OpenXR API to capture detailed movements and positions of the human body in a virtual environment.
- **Full Body Tracking:** Incorporate additional tracking devices for the feet and hips to enhance the accuracy and realism of motion capture.
- **Inverse Kinematics:** Full Body Tracking estimates body locations in real life using IK systems to approximate joint rotations and positions for accurate tracking of all body parts.
- **Export to .fbx:** Export recorded motion data as an animated .fbx file, compatible with popular 3D modeling and animation software.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity Engine
- SteamVR Plugin
- OpenXR API

### Installation
